# RGBLighting
This repository contains lighting functionality in a room through the use of Individually addresible RGB Leds

## How to Install
Clone this repository. Load the files into the microcontroller

## Hardware
- Arduino
- Adafruit Circuit Playground
- Adafruit Gemma M0
- Individually addressible RGB Led lights

##Project Idea
The goal of this project is be able to multi-funcitonal RGB Led lights quickly and easily. The entire setup process should take under 15 minutes.
The lights should have multiple interfaces. One based on physical buttons that control the color, brightness, and mode of the lights. Another interface is Web-Based such as to allow remote  control.

### Button Interface
- 3 buttons

### Web Interface
- buttons
- data graphs

### Light Modes and Functionality
